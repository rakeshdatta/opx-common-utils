# opx-common-utils
This repository contains a utilities library used by the OPX project for thread queues, mutex support, and other items. It is recommended that all utility code - used by more then one OPX component - be placed in this repository. For example, the event service used by the CPS. The API that starts, stops, and the infrastructure for events are in the _event_ sources, while the user code is in the `opx-cps` repository.

##Packages
Contained within this repository are  
libopx-common1\_*version*\_*arch*.deb      - Utility libraries  
libopx-common-dev\_*version*\_*arch*.deb   - Exported header files

See https://github.com/open-switch/opx-docs/wiki/Architecture for information on the common utilities module.
